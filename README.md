# HPC-SVD-PCA-project

## Parallel PCA & SVD Implementation
High-performance implementations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) using parallel computing techniques for large datasets. 
Key features:
- Parallelization (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA);
- From-scratch implementation of linear algebra operations;
- Benchmarking to compare performance against sklearn PCA;
- Visualization of eigenvalue spectra and projections.
